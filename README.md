# Quiz Game / Stranger Things Quiz

Quiz Game is a Stranger Things Quiz that is aimed at viewers of the hit tv series "Stranger Things". 

It is meant as a bit of light-hearted fun and to test people on their Stranger Things knowledge.

There is a high scores leader board so users can compare their high scores.


## UX 

The scope of this project was to build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.
Required technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
