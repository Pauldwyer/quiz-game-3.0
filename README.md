# Quiz Game / Stranger Things Quiz

Quiz Game is a Stranger Things Quiz that is aimed at viewers of the hit tv series "Stranger Things". 

It is meant as a bit of light-hearted fun and to test people on their Stranger Things knowledge.

There is a high scores leader board so users can compare their high scores.


## UX 

### Project Goals

The scope of this project was to build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, and alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.
Required technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### User Stories

### Design

- Colours
  - For the colours for this site I took inspiration from Cyberpunk themes and Synthwave themes. I really like that aestheic and since Stranger Things is set in the 80s i feel like these were a perfect match.
  I used the following 2 palletes for most of the colours on the site.

  - For the background colour a gradient was made from the following 3 colours. Gradient generated with [CSS Gradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/)

- Font
  - For the font I used VT323, I was searching google looking for 80s style fonts and I found this GitHub page [Fonts Inspiration](https://github.com/torch2424/aesthetic-css). This page had a list of google fonts that work well with the theme and aesthic i was going for.


## Features

  - [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)


  - [GitHub](https://github.com/)


  - [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)


## Testing 

Throughout development of the project, code was regularly tested using Chrome developer tools, manual testing was performed and code was passed through validators like W3C for HTML, Jigsaw for CSS and Jshint for JS.

List of devices that the website was tested on for responsiveness through chrome developer tools:

- iPhone SE
- iPhone XR
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S8
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- Samsung Galaxy A51/71
- Samsung Galaxy A52/A53 5g

### Manual Testing

- The site was tested manually on google chrome desktop.
- Goal of the testing was to check if the functionality of each button across all pages. If they were working as intended and eliciting the correct response ie. increment scrore for each correct answer, change colour for correct and incorrect answer.
- See below steps, expected results and results.

### Bugs

- First bug i encountered during development was incorrect file paths when the site was deployed to GitHug Pages.
  I was using the incorrect file paths, which worked correctly when using a live 8000 server from GitPod but once the site was deployed all links were broken. Play worked on the home page and the buttons to answer questions were the only buttons that worked correctly.
  To fix this issue i used the relative file path for all page links.

- Second bug i encountered was when the site was live when using chrome developer tools there was console errors when on the home page, end page and high scores page. See below screenshot of the error.
To fix this error i removed the script.js from the those 3 pages. This fixed the console error.    
![Console Error](assets/images/Home-page-bug.png)

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In settings click the Pages link on the left sidebar
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
